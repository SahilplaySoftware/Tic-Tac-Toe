# Java Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple command-line-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Java. This project allows two players to take turns playing the game on the terminal.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the Java files by running the following command:

   ```
   javac TicTacToe.java
   ```

4. Start the game by running the following command:

   ```
   java TicTacToe
   ```

5. The game will begin, and the board will be displayed on the terminal.
6. Players will take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column where they want to place their symbol (X or O). For example, to place your symbol in the top-left corner, you can enter `1 1`.
7. The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full (a draw).

## Rules

- Two players take turns to play.
- The first player is X, and the second player is O.
- To win, a player must have three of their symbols (X or O) in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
- If all cells on the board are filled, and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Simple command-line interface for easy play.
- Proper input validation to prevent illegal moves.
- Automatic detection of a win or draw.
- Clean and well-structured Java code for easy understanding and modification.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future enhancements to this Tic-Tac-Toe game:

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Add a computer player with varying levels of difficulty.
- Allow customization of player names and symbols.
- Implement a scoring system for multiple rounds of play.
- Add a feature to restart the game without restarting the program.
